## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
class(Mat1)
typeof(Mat1)
Mat1 <- matrix(
  c(1:6), 2,3
)
Mat1
matmat<-matrix(
  c(1:10),5,2
)
matmat
```

```{r}
Mat1[[4]]
class(Mat1[[4]])
```
